if two strings differ in length, return False 

if two strings don't differ in length 

iterate through string1 from left to right (pointer i), iterate through string2 from right to left (pointer j) 

return False if the char element at current pointers don't match up

if iterate until i > len(string1) and j > len(string2) without any problem, return True
